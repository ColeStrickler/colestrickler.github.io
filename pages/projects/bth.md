See full project and source code here: [BTH](https://github.com/ColeStrickler/BTH?tab=readme-ov-file).

This project was done in the interest of increasing my productivity at my former employer. Many PE file format and memory dump analysis tools were rather slow, and none of them had all of the features that I wanted in a single suite. BTH has the following features:
*   Hex editor
*   PE file format parser
*   Structure Overlay/Editor ideal for memory dump analysis and analysis of other file types
*   Disassembler
*   Complete color customization
*   String Scanner
*   Byte Scanner
*   Embedded Python interpreter with exposed orchestration API
*   Use of modern C++ 20 for easy extension and hackability
