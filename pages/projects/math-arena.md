This project is still a work in progress. The goal of this project was to build something like Desmos graphing calculator. Mine isn't quite as pretty yet. So far the features are:

*   Can compile arbitrary 3D equations into OpenGL meshes
*   Equation solver that leverages numerous automatic algebraic capabiltiies via compiler technology
