See full project and source code here: [SLR(0) Generator](https://github.com/ColeStrickler/CompilerInfra/tree/main/projects/t3).

This project takes in an LR(0) grammar, and produces an LR(0) automaton and a header ready parser. This project closely follows the algorithms seen in section 4.6 of the [Dragon Book](https://www.amazon.com/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-Tools-2nd/dp/0321486811).
