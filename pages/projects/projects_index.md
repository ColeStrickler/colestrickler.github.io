*   x86-64 SMP operating system written entirely from scratch

#### [1337visor](/pages/projects/1337-hypervisor.html)
*   Type-2 AMD SVM Hypervisor created for security research and reverse-engineering

#### [Voxel Engine](/pages/projects/voxel-engine.html)
*   Pretty much a Minecraft clone in OpenGL

#### [MemGuard Port](/pages/projects/memguard-port.html)
*   Port of MemGuard to RISC-V & FireSim environment 
*   Modification of RocketChip L2 Cache with performance counters and interrupts
*   MemGuard driver modification to support PLIC routing

#### [Reproducing GhostRace](/pages/projects/ghostrace.html)
*   Re-creation of micro-architectural attack techniques seen in the Ghostrace paper

#### [CS:GO Mod Menu](/pages/projects/csgo-haxorz.html)
*   Full scale mod menu for Counter-Strike Global Offensive that is undetectable online

#### [DNN Framework in C++](/pages/projects/dnn-from-scratch.html)
*   DNN framework in raw C++. Supports both training and loading weights

#### [RegEx Compiler/Scanner Generator](/pages/projects/regex-compiler.html)
*   Complete scanner generator suitable for a compiler front-end

#### [MathArena](/pages/projects/math-arena.html)
*   Compile equations into 3D graphs in OpenGL

#### [SDT Generator](/pages/projects/sdt-generator.html)
