See full project and source code here: [SDT Generator](https://github.com/ColeStrickler/CompilerInfra/tree/main/projects/t2).

This project takes in an LL(1) grammar, and outputs a program that can test if an input matches that grammar. The project very closely follows the algorithms shown in section 4.4 of the [Dragon Book](https://www.amazon.com/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-Tools-2nd/dp/0321486811).
